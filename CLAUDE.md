# CLAUDE.md — pihole-wtm

Project-level instructions for Claude Code. These apply to every conversation in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Stack**: FastAPI (Python 3.12, aiosqlite/SQLite) + Vue 3 (TypeScript, PrimeVue, Pinia, Vite). Dev environment runs via ddev.

**What it does**: Syncs Pi-hole DNS query history, enriches domains with tracker intelligence (Ghostery TrackerDB, Disconnect.me, RDAP), and serves a dashboard.

## Architecture Patterns

**Adding a new stat/data type**: DB method in `database.py` → route in `main.py` → TS interface in `api.ts`.

**Adding a new dialog**: follow the `DeviceStatsDialog` / `DomainClientsDialog` pattern — `visible = ref(true)`, emits `close` on hide, mounted with `v-if` in parent view.

**Report filters**: `useReportData` composable owns filter state, URL query param sync, and data fetching for both domain and client report views.

**Time window**: always use `useWindowStore().queryParams({...})` to build API query strings so the active time window is included.

**Exclusions**: every new stats DB method must call `await this._apply_exclusions(conditions, params)` so user exclusion settings are respected.

## Python Linting Notes

When suppressing a ruff rule across multiple lines (e.g. a multi-line f-string), use block-level comments — `# ruff: disable[RULE]` on the line before and `# ruff: enable[RULE]` after. Do not use `# noqa: RULE` on the opening line of a multi-line construct — it becomes part of the string content, not a comment.

## Dev Commands

Full details in `docs/development.md`. All commands run via ddev; Python tools require the `.venv/bin/` prefix.

```bash
# Linting + type checking
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/backend .venv/bin/ruff check app tests
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/backend .venv/bin/mypy app
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/frontend npm run lint
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/frontend npm run type-check

# Tests
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/backend .venv/bin/pytest
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/frontend npm run test
```

## Commits

Uses Conventional Commits. `feat:` → minor bump, `fix:` → patch bump, `chore:`/`refactor:`/`test:` → no changelog entry. Release Please batches all commits into one release PR — multiple `feat:` commits don't cause multiple version bumps.

---

## Code Review Workflow

After completing a significant feature or refactor, suggest a code review of the files touched. When reviewing: read files thoroughly first, flag findings by severity (🔴 Must Fix / 🟡 Should Fix / 🟢 Minor), and add any deferred 🟢 items to [`docs/tech-debt.md`](docs/tech-debt.md) so they aren't lost.
